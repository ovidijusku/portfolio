## My "wannabe programmer" portfolio

Hi there! I'm new to programming and I am keen to dig deeper into Python (such libraries as Pandas, Numpy). I will put my recent projects inside this repository. Projects will be represented in Jupyter Notebooks.

You can always message me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovidijus-kuzminas).

##### Results
1. First quarantine was on time and it fullfilled the most important goal to prevent disease from spreading.
2. The second quarantine was two months after the relevant prevention time.
3. When the second quarantine was announced, it was not effective in terms of new cases and deaths (might be different reasons: too liberal restrictions, collective unconsciousness, lack of political will, etc).
