## My "wannabe programmer" portfolio

*"Everything on the Internet is true"* /Albert Einstein/

Hi there! I'm new to programming and I am keen to dig deeper into Python (such libraries as Pandas, Numpy). I will put my recent projects inside this repository. Projects will be represented in Jupyter Notebooks.

#### [Police shooting in US](https://github.com/ovidijusku/portfolio/blob/main/Police%20shooting%20in%20US/Capstone%20on%20police%20shooting.ipynb)

##### BACKGROUND
After George Floyd, there were lots of protests in U.S. against violent police arrests. This project will answer the question if Black Lives Matter movement had statistically correct reason to blame U.S. police for using fatal force against black community. Moreover, from the data, I will provide some insights how to reduce the total numbers of killed suspects.

##### Results
**1. Increasing number of body cameras per patrol**
From EDA we saw that only 11% of fatal arrests were recorded. From open source information, 47% of departments were using body cameras. There is a statistical significance between those two numbers even without proceeding the Z-test. There could be couple of options:

* Despite the fact that police department has body cameras, their number is too low to give at least one per patrolling vehicle. In this case, the solution could be increase the number of cameras.
* Police officers are not using these cameras. In this case, solution should be impact on standard police procedures by putting responsibility on police officer for gathering arrest forensics on tape.

**2. Increasing number of police officers**
Lithuania, having lower murder per capita rate and having much lower gun ownership rate, have more police officers than U.S. What is really depressing, that U.S. try to solve this problem by making police patrol size of one person and that's where bad things start to happen. Because when you work in pair, one police officer could be as a back up to another and they can prevent some of the fatal arrests just by switching responsibilities (for example one cop approaching with taser, another one with firearm). When they leave police officer on their own, his only ability to survive is to use firearm as a primary response to any attack.

#### [Covid-19 Spread in Lithuania](https://github.com/ovidijusku/portfolio/blob/main/COVID%20Lithuania/Project%20COVID.ipynb)

##### BACKGROUND
Lithuania was one of the countries with extremely low cases and deaths during the first COVID wave. However, situation changed dramatically during the second COVID wave and statistics turned over.

Goal of this project is to get insights why the situation become uncontrollable.

Hypothesis: The second quarantine was announced too late.

##### Results
1. First quarantine was on time and it fullfilled the most important goal to prevent disease from spreading.
2. The second quarantine was two months after the cases grew to the level of the first quarantine.
3. However, other European countries announced quarantine even having more cases and deaths (per capita) and they did not acquired such huge numbers as Lithuania.
4. There might be different reasons for the actual quarantine exponential growth: too liberal restrictions, collective unconsciousness. Most likely, they will lead to social behaviour.
5. We can reject the hypothesis that the second quarantine was announced to late.
