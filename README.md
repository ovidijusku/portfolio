### Projects

#### Covid-19 Spread in Lithuania

PICTURE

##### Results
1. First quarantine was on time and it fullfilled the most important goal to prevent disease from spreading.
2. The second quarantine was two months after the relevant prevention time.
3. When the second quarantine was announced, it was not effective in terms of new cases and deaths (might be different reasons: too liberal restrictions, collective unconsciousness, lack of political will, etc).
