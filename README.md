## My "wannabe programmer" portfolio

*"Everything on the Internet is true"* /Albert Einstein/

Hi there! I'm new to programming and I am keen to dig deeper into Python (such libraries as Pandas, Numpy). I will put my recent projects inside this repository. Projects will be represented in Jupyter Notebooks.

#### [Covid-19 Spread in Lithuania](https://github.com/ovidijusku/portfolio/blob/main/COVID%20Lithuania/Project%20COVID.ipynb)

##### BACKGROUND
Lithuania was one of the countries with extremely low cases and deaths during the first COVID wave. However, situation changed dramatically during the second COVID wave and statistics turned over.

Goal of this project is to get insights why the situation become uncontrollable.

Hypothesis: The second quarantine was announced too late.

##### Results
1. First quarantine was on time and it fullfilled the most important goal to prevent disease from spreading.
2. The second quarantine was two months after the cases grew to the level of the first quarantine.
3. However, other European countries announced quarantine even having more cases and deaths (per capita) and they did not acquired such huge numbers as Lithuania.
4. There might be different reasons for the actual quarantine exponential growth: too liberal restrictions, collective unconsciousness. Most likely, they will lead to social behaviour.
5. We can reject the hypothesis that the second quarantine was announced to late.
